## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-07

### Added

#### AST Reference Guide
- New comprehensive documentation at `documents/AST-REFERENCE.md` covering the complete VMPrint document input format
- Detailed reference for every supported node type, property, style field, and configuration option
- Examples for `DocumentInput`, `LayoutConfig`, elements, and page regions

#### Full Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm Support
- Complete implementation of Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9) for proper RTL/LTR text handling
- New `bidi-js` dependency added to engine for embedding level calculation
- New `splitByBidiDirection()` function in `text-script-segmentation.ts` for BIDI run segmentation
- Intelligent neutral character handling — spaces and punctuation between LTR/RTL runs are now properly assigned based on neighboring strong characters
- New engine test fixture: `18-multilingual-arabic` with comprehensive Arabic and mixed bidi layout coverage

### Fixed

#### RTL and Mixed Bidi Rendering
- RTL text now renders with full UAX #9 compliance
- Mixed LTR/RTL text within paragraphs now displays with correct visual ordering
- Arabic text shaping correctly applies contextual forms (initial, medial, final, isolated) with proper glyph connection
- Embedded LTR runs within RTL paragraphs (and vice versa) now render in the correct visual order
- Fixed item-order reversal for LTR runs within RTL lines to ensure proper visual placement

### Changed

#### Engine Bidirectional Text Processing
- `reorderItemsForRtl()` now respects pre-computed BIDI direction from layout engine instead of re-sniffing text
- Text processor measurement cache keys now include direction and script class for context-aware caching
- Font shaping integration improved — script tags (`arab`, `deva`, `thai`, etc.) and direction (`ltr`/`rtl`) now properly passed to fontkit
- RTL runs now use explicit OpenType feature list for consistent shaping across measurement and rendering
- All layout snapshot fixtures regenerated to reflect the improved bidi handling

#### Documentation
- README updated to remove note about partial RTL/bidi support — full support is now implemented
- All language showcase images regenerated with improved bidi rendering

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-07

### Added

#### `@vmprint/context-pdf-lite`
A lightweight PDF rendering context powered by jsPDF for embeddable and browser-friendly PDF output.

- New `contexts/pdf-lite` package
- Packaged integration coverage for the built engine + standard fonts + pdf-lite stack
- Root build now includes the pdf-lite workspace

#### Browser Documentation Examples
- New self-contained static AST-to-PDF showcase under `docs/examples/ast-to-pdf/`
- New self-contained static Markdown-to-AST showcase under `docs/examples/mkd-to-ast/`
- Example bundling/build pipeline added under `scripts/build-docs-examples.mjs`
- `docs/README.md` and example landing pages expanded to cover the static demos

#### Markdown Transmuter
- New `@vmprint/transmuter-mkd` package for converting Markdown into VMPrint `DocumentInput`
- Theme-aware transmutation with bundled default, novel, and opensource themes
- New transmuter documentation under `transmuters/README.md` and `transmuters/mkd-mkd/README.md`

#### Header and Footer Page Regions
- New top-level `header` / `footer` document regions with `default`, `firstPage`, `odd`, and `even` selectors
- New per-element `pageOverrides` for page-local header/footer replacement or suppression
- New physical/logical page-number token substitution in region content
- New engine regression fixture and design docs for page-region behavior

#### Markdown Novel Theme
- New `novel` theme for `draft2final` markdown output
- Matching bundled `novel` theme for the Markdown transmuter
- New layout snapshot coverage for the markdown novel sample

### Changed

#### Engine Rendering and Layout
- Rich inline baseline alignment and rendering metrics were tightened engine-wide
- Renderer and debug drawing paths were updated to match the new rich-line metrics flow
- Header/footer geometry now lives inside page margins rather than spanning the full page width
- Region content is laid out under a region-local, non-paginating context and clipped to the available margin box

#### `draft2final`
- Theme loading now supports document-level `header` / `footer` definitions in addition to layout and styles
- Markdown themes were updated to use page-region-driven folios instead of the old flat page-number settings
- Test fixtures and layout snapshots were expanded for the new region model

### Fixed

- `@vmprint/transmuter-mkd` build breakage in the bundled `novel` theme source
- Packaged integration flow after a clean root build by ensuring pdf-lite artifacts are generated
- Header/footer regression fixtures and assertions so they validate the intended margin-bounded region model

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

#### StandardFontManager (`@vmprint/standard-fonts`)
A zero-asset `FontManager` that supports all 14 PDF standard fonts without requiring any font files to be installed or bundled.

- New `@vmprint/font-managers/standard` package with `StandardFontManager`
- Alias table covering all 14 standard fonts plus metric-compatible families: Arimo, Tinos, Cousine, Carlito, Caladea, Noto Sans, and Courier Prime
- Engine: sentinel detection in the font cache loader; `AfmFontProxy` backed by static AFM metric tables (generated from PDFKit's `.afm` files); per-glyph advance widths and bounding boxes
- AFM tables keyed by Unicode codepoint (not Adobe Standard Encoding) so extended characters — en-dash, em-dash, smart quotes, etc. — resolve correctly
- `contexts/pdf`: suppresses font embedding for standard fonts and passes the PostScript name directly to PDFKit using WinAnsiEncoding
- `font-managers/local`: added Symbol and ZapfDingbats aliases pointing to Noto Sans Symbols 2
- Architecture documentation: `documents/STANDARD-FONTS.md`

#### Multi-Column Layouts
- Story packager extended with full multi-column layout support
- Column count, gutter width, and per-column flow are driven by the existing engine document model
- New engine regression test and fixture: `15-story-multi-column`

#### Manuscript Format (`draft2final`)
- New industry-compliant `manuscript` format for `draft2final` with two themes: **default** and **classic**
- Smart quotes and smart dashes applied automatically within manuscript documents
- Manuscript format includes its own config defaults, validator, and theme YAML files
- New layout snapshot fixtures: `manuscript-layout-sample` and `manuscript-classic-layout-sample`
- `draft2final/MANUSCRIPT.md` — authoring and format reference

#### `VmprintOutputStream` contract
- New `VmprintOutputStream` interface in `@vmprint/contracts`: a portable `write` / `end` / `waitForFinish` abstraction that callers implement against their own I/O transport
- `Context` contract now requires a `pipe(stream: VmprintOutputStream): void` method; no-op implementations are explicitly allowed for contexts that manage their own output
- `NodeWriteStreamAdapter` added in CLI and `draft2final` to bridge Node.js `fs.WriteStream` into `VmprintOutputStream`, keeping filesystem I/O in the caller

### Changed

#### draft2final Architecture Overhaul
The `draft2final` package was substantially restructured to make creating new formats straightforward and reduce per-format boilerplate.

- **"Flavor" renamed to "Theme"** throughout the codebase — themes are now the canonical term for format variants
- Each format (`academic`, `literature`, `markdown`, `screenplay`) was extracted from a monolithic index file into a dedicated `format.ts` module with a `config.defaults.yaml` and a `themes/` directory containing per-theme YAML
- New shared compiler infrastructure under `draft2final/src/formats/compiler/`:
  - `compile.ts` — orchestrates format compilation
  - `config-resolver.ts` — resolves layered configuration (defaults → theme → user overrides)
  - `format-context.ts` — shared format rendering context
  - `format-handler.ts` — base handler interface
  - `inline.ts` — shared inline element compilation
  - `image.ts` — image handling utilities
  - `numbering.ts` — numbering utilities
  - `theme-loader.ts` — theme YAML loading
  - `markdown-base-format.ts` — shared base for Markdown-derived formats
  - `rule-based-handler.ts` — declarative rule-based element dispatcher
- `build.ts` and `cli.ts` updated to use the new format registry
- `format-loader.ts` (previously `flavor-loader.ts`) removed in favour of the new `formats/index.ts` registry

#### Additive Margins
Margin behaviour changed from **collapsing** to **additive** across the engine and all `draft2final` formats.

- Adjacent block margins now sum rather than collapse, matching standard typesetting conventions
- All `draft2final` format themes (academic, literature, markdown, screenplay) updated with recalibrated margin values
- All layout snapshot fixtures regenerated to reflect the new behaviour
- Engine: `paginate-packagers.ts` updated with the new margin accumulation logic

#### Removed Variable Font Support
Variable font (`.wdf` / `wght`-axis) support has been removed from the engine and context to simplify font handling and make writing new contexts easier.

- Engine: variable-font axis resolution removed from `layout-utils.ts`, `text-processor.ts`, and `font-registration.ts`
- `contexts/pdf`: variable font subsetting code removed; `fontkit.d.ts` shim removed; `pdfkit-fontkit` dependency dropped
- `font-managers/local`: variable font assets (ArimoVariable) replaced with four static TTF files (Regular, Bold, Italic, BoldItalic)
- `contracts`: `FontManager` interface simplified — variable-font fields removed
- Engine font-management ops simplified accordingly

#### CLI: Removed `--context` flag
The `--context` flag has been removed from the CLI.

- The flag's pluggability was illusory: the undocumented two-argument constructor made third-party contexts non-functional
- The CLI is now an honest PDF tool; `PdfContext` is used directly
- `PdfContext` constructor simplified to `(options: ContextFactoryOptions)` only; `pipe()` now bridges via PDFKit's `data`/`end` events into `VmprintOutputStream` instead of accepting a Node.js stream directly
- CLI's `--font-manager` flag resolution fixed: bare package names are resolved via `require.resolve`; file paths via `path.resolve`

### Fixed

- Superscript rendering in the engine (`engine/src/engine/layout/text-wrap-core.ts`, `rich-line-draw.ts`)
- AFM proxy `glyphForCodePoint` now does a direct Unicode lookup, removing the intermediate WIN_ANSI_CODE_MAP that caused extended characters to resolve incorrectly

### Reorganized

- `samples/` directory restructured for discoverability:
  - `samples/draft2final/source/` — source documents grouped by format
  - `samples/engine/tests/` — all engine regression PDFs
  - `samples/overlay/` — overlay pipeline outputs
- `documents/readme-assets/` — README images and hero assets moved out of `documents/readme/`
- Removed stale `documents/ROADMAP.md` and `documents/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_LOG.md`
